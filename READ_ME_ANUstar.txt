These files contain CSV records for all MACHO stars. Organised as one file for all stars in a given MACHO field.

Each file is gzipped.

The format of the files is:

field_id, tile_id, sequence_id, ra, dec, (ra,dec):radians, ....

The triple (field_id, tile_id, sequence_id) uniquely identifies a particular star.
